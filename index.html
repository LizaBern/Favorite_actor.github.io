              Daniel Wroughton Craig (born 2 March 1968) is an English actor. He gained international fame playing James
              Bond in the eponymous film series, beginning with Casino Royale (2006), and in four further installments, up
              until No Time to Die (2021).
              After training at the National Youth Theatre in London and graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and
              Drama in 1991, Craig began his career on stage. He made his film debut in the drama The Power of One (1992)
              and the family film A Kid in King Arthur's Court (1995), with his breakthrough role coming in the drama
              serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He gained roles in the period film Elizabeth (1998), the action film
              Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), before appearing in the crime thrillers Road to Perdition (2002), Layer Cake
              (2004), and the historical drama film Munich (2005).
              Casino Royale, a reboot of the Bond franchise released in November 2006, was favourably received by critics
              and earned Craig a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His non-Bond appearances
              since then include roles in fantasy film The Golden Compass (2007), the drama Defiance (2008), the science
              fiction Western Cowboys & Aliens (2011), the mystery thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), the
              heist film Logan Lucky (2017), and the mystery comedy Knives Out (2019).

              <h4 id="pers_life" style="text-align: center"><em>Early life</em></h4>
              Daniel Wroughton Craig was born in Chester on 2 March 1968, the son of Carol Olivia (née Williams), an art
              teacher, and Timothy John Wroughton Craig (1943–2020), a midshipman in the Merchant Navy and steel erector.
              His father later became the landlord of two Cheshire pubs: the Ring o' Bells in Frodsham and the Boot Inn in
              Tarporley.Craig has an older sister named Lea (born 1965).He is of French and Welsh descent, counting the
              French Huguenot minister Daniel Chamier and Sir William Burnaby, 1st Baronet among his ancestors. His middle
              name, Wroughton, comes from his great-great-grandmother, Grace Matilda Wroughton.
              When Craig's parents divorced in 1972, he and his sister moved to the Wirral Peninsula with their mother,
              where he attended primary school in Hoylake as well as school in Frodsham. He attended Hilbre High School in
              West Kirby. <span class="fill">Upon leaving there at the age of 16, he attended Calday Grange Grammar School

              Craig appeared in his first screen role in 1992, playing an Afrikaner in The Power of One. Having played minor roles in the miniseries Anglo-Saxon Attitudes and the shows Covington Cross and Boon, he appeared in November 1993 as Joe in the Royal National Theatre's production of Tony Kushner's Angels in America. Also in 1993, Craig was featured in two episodes of the American television shows Zorro and The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and British shows Heartbeat, Between the Lines, Drop the Dead Donkey and Sharpe's Eagle. In 1994, Craig appeared in The Rover, a filmed stage production and Les Grandes Horizontales, a stage production at the National Theatre Studio, where he first met Rachel Weisz, who would become his second wife. Craig was featured in the poorly received Disney film A Kid in King Arthur's Court (1995). In 1996, Craig starred in the BBC drama serial Our Friends in the North as the troubled George 'Geordie' Peacock. Appearing alongside Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong, Craig's part in the series is considered his breakthrough role. In the same year, Craig guest-starred in an episode of the HBO horror anthology series Tales from the Crypt and was featured in the BBC television film Saint-Ex. Craig gave a lead performance in the Franco-German drama Obsession in 1997, about a love triangle between Craig's character and a couple. The same year, he played a leading role in Hurlyburly, a play performed in the West End at the Old Vic. Craig appeared in three films in 1998: the independent drama Love and Rage, the biographical drama Elizabeth, in which he played Jesuit priest John Ballard, who was executed for being involved in an attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I of England in the Babington Plot

              In 2005, Craig was contacted by Eon Productions to portray James Bond. Initially, he was unsure about the role and was resistant to the producers' overtures. "There was a period of trying to woo him" longtime Bond co-producer Barbara Broccoli later commented in 2012. During this period, he sought advice from colleagues and friends, of whom "most of us said to him...'there is life after Bond'.". He stated he "was aware of the challenges" of the Bond franchise, which he considered "a big machine that makes a lot of money". He aimed at bringing more "emotional depth" to the character. Born in 1968, Craig is the first actor to portray James Bond to have been born after the Bond series started and after the death of Ian Fleming, the novels' writer. The casting choice caused significant controversy. Throughout the entire production period, internet campaigns expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, blond and 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m), was not considered by some protesters to fit the taller, dark-haired Bond portrayed by the previous Bond actors, to which viewers had apparently become accustomed. Although the choice of Craig was controversial, numerous actors publicly voiced their support. Most notably four of the five actors who had previously portrayed Bond – Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton – called his casting a good decision. Connery notably shared his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond in 2008, describing him as "fantastic, marvelous in the part". The other actor to have previously played Bond, George Lazenby, has since voiced his approval of Craig also. Clive Owen, who had been linked to the role, also spoke in defence of Craig.
